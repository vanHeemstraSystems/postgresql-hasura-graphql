# PostgreSQL &amp; Hasura GraphQL

Based on "Deploy Hasura GraphQL Engine" at https://render.com/docs/deploy-hasura-graphql

The [Hasura GraphQL engine](https://hasura.io/docs/latest/graphql/core/index.html) makes your data instantly accessible over a real-time GraphQL API, so you can build and ship modern apps and APIs faster. Hasura connects to your databases, REST servers, GraphQL servers, and third party APIs to provide a unified realtime GraphQL API across all your data sources.

Related to "Chemplexity Servings" at https://github.com/vanHeemstraSystems/chemplexity-servings where we try to display a chemical molecule - aka a servings - (called: "Cereals") that sources it data from our Hasura GraphQL https://hasura-7exz.onrender.com/console/api/api-explorer backed by a Postgress Database, hosted on Render.com
