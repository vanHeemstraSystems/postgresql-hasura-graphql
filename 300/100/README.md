# 100 - One-Click Deploy

Following the instructions at https://render.com/docs/deploy-hasura-graphql

Click Deploy to Render below to set up Hasura GraphQL Engine on your Render account. This will deploy the Hasura GraphQL Engine web service and create a PostgreSQL database used to store both your application data and GraphQL Engineâ€™s metadata.

[Deploy to Render](https://render.com/deploy?repo=https://github.com/render-examples/hasura-graphql)

By default, the Hasura GraphQL web console is not password-protected. To secure it, create an environment variable named ```HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET``` for the web service you just deployed in the Render Dashboard.
