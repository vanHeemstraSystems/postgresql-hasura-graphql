# 100 - One-Click Deploy

Following the instructions at https://render.com/docs/deploy-hasura-graphql

The created instance of Hasura GraphQL

By default, the Hasura GraphQL web console is not password-protected. To secure it, create an environment variable named ```HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET``` for the web service you just deployed in the Render Dashboard.

For this go to https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-cglaj98rddleudr00ku0/env and add an Environment Variable Key and Value as follows:

Result from Adding an Environment Variable

**REMEMBER** the value of the ```HASURA_GRAPHQL_ADMIN_SECRET``` well, as you may need to enter it later on.
